        <h2>Note on Specialization and Data Limitations</h2>
        <p><strong>Understanding Specialization:</strong></p>
        <p>Determining the exact specialization of a hospital can be challenging, as many hospitals offer a wide range of medical services. While some may specialize in a particular field (e.g., cardiology, oncology), others may be more general-purpose.</p>

            <li>The data may not be entirely up-to-date.</li>
            <li>Hospital specializations can change over time.</li>
            <li>Some hospitals may not have explicit information about their specializations listed in the provided data.</li>
        </ul>
